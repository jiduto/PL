      <h1>Misc Info:</h1>
      <p>Arriving on time gives you a $1000 chip bonus. Being on time also gives you 3 bonus points in the standings. You can be late and be blinded out until you arrive, but you must arrive by the end of the 1st break (about 1 hour in).</p>
      <p>We draw seats before each game to determine seating.</p>
      <p>The season will last 12 months with a plan of playing 11 games plus the Freeroll.</p>
      <p>The buy in is $40. We will take out 25% of the pot to put towards the bonus prize pool. 100% of that bonus prize pool is paid out the night of the Freeroll. You must play in at least 50% of the games in order to qualify for the Freeroll and prizes.</p>

      <h1>How to score points:</h1>
      <p>The league uses a points system, and points are obtained in a few different ways:</p>
      
      <h2>Finish Points</h2>
      <p>You get points based on where you finish, in reverse of the number of players in the tournament. Here is an example for a 10 player tournament:</p>
      <p class="indented">1st place:       10 pts</p>
      <p class="indented">2nd place:       9 pts</p>
      <p class="indented">3rd place:       8 pts</p>
      <p class="indented">etc...             etc...</p>
      <p class="indented">10th place:      1 pt</p>

      <h2>ITM Bonus</h2>
      <p>This is for finishing in any position that makes it In The Money (ITM), and is in reverse of the number of spots paid out. For example, in a 10 player tournament that pays the top 3 positions, the ITM bonus would be:</p>
      <p class="indented">1st place:       3 pts</p>
      <p class="indented">2nd place:       2 pts</p>
      <p class="indented">3rd place:       1 pt</p>

      <h2>KO’s</h2>
      <p>Each knockout is worth 1 point.</p>

      <h2>Bounty Bonus</h2>
      <p>Whoever won the previous tournament is the bounty. If you knock out the bounty you get 1 point. If you are the bounty and win the tournament you get 2 points, and will be the bounty again for the next tournament. If the bounty player is not in attendance it will be whoever the next highest finisher from the previous tournament was. For game #1 whoever wins the button will be that game’s bounty.</p>

      <h2>On-Time Bonus</h2>
      <p>You get 3 points for being on time each week.</p>

      <h1>The bonus prize pool:</h1>
      <p>In order to be eligible for the prize pool bonuses and the Freeroll, you need to play in at least 50% of the league games.</p>
      <p>The prize pool is divided as follows:</p>
      <p class="indented">1) There is a $100 prize for the top overall point leader at the end of the season.</p>
      <p class="indented">2) There is a high hand jackpot for the player who had the high hand for the season (details below.) The high hand jackpot is $50.</p>
      <p class="indented">3) The rest of the money goes towards the Freeroll prize pool.</p>

      <h1>High hand jackpot:</h1>
      <p>The high hand must be 4 of a kind or better, and must use at least 1 hole card to qualify. For a 4 of a Kind the hole card must be part of the 4 (not a kicker). A high hand does not need to come to showdown (the other players in the hand can all fold) but the cards must be shown at the end of the hand to qualify. If there is no high hand during the season, the high hand jackpot will be added to the Freeroll prize pool.</p>

      <h1>The Freeroll:</h1>
      <p>The base starting stack for the Freeroll is $10000 chips, with bonus chips added to it. Each point accumulated throughout the season = $100 in extra chips. If you score 100 points during the season, your Freeroll chip stack would be the starting $10,000 plus an additional $10,000 for a total stack of $20,000 in chips.</p>
