    <div class="rules-content">
      <p>ACTING OUT OF TURN – You may not act out of turn. Sometimes this is accidental, and that is okay, but please be observant and do your best to only act when it is your turn to act.</p><br><br>
      <p>TALKING ABOUT A HAND – You are not allowed to discuss your hand if you have folded. An example would be that if you threw a 7 4 and the flop came down 10 7 7 and you started complaining about having folded a 7. This gives information away to players still in the hand and therefore is not allowed. If you are in a hand, table talk is okay and, in my opinion, is part of the game. If another player in the hand asks if you have a 7, you can say whatever you want. It is up to them to make the proper read or not.</p><br><br>
      <p>PROTECT YOUR CARDS – Please protect your cards. You can do this by placing a chip or trinket on top of them. It is also best to keep them close to you near the edge of the table. I have had incidents where a player left their cards out without protecting them and I grabbed them and put them in the muck by mistake. If a player fails to protect their cards and they are placed in the muck, it is the player’s fault and the hand is dead. If the cards were protected it is the dealer’s fault and a mis-deal can be called.</p><br><br>
      <p>CALLING FOR TIME – A player may ask for additional time to decide on a move. This time is approximately one minute. Also, a player may call for a one minute hand timer on another player that is taking too long.</p><br><br>
      <p>BETS AND RAISES – Because this is no-limit, there is no maximum bet or raise amount, nor is there a limit on the number of raises in a hand. A bet or raise does, however, have a minimum. A bet must be at least the same amount as the current Big Blind, and a raise must be at least the amount that was originally bet or raised.</p><br><br>
      <p>SITTING OUT – A player is allowed to sit out of as many hands as wanted. If a player is sitting out, their blinds will be posted and hands folded until the player sits down. Players sitting out will finish in the place they went out. If you have to leave a tournament early, you can post and fold and will finish how your chips finish.</p><br><br>
      <p>LATE ARRIVAL – Players are allowed to be late. If you are going to be late, please let me know ASAP. A late player will have a seat reserved with chips and will be treated as if they were sitting out (blinds posted, hands folded until arrival.) A player who promises to show must pay for the tournament buy-in. This means that if you tell me you will be here to play, and I put out your chips and post/fold you for a tournament, you owe the tournament buy-in and must pay it before you can play in another game. I will allow a one-time exception to every player, but after that you will have to pay before you can play again. The only other exception is in an emergency that the other players agree on was an emergency.</p><br><br>
      <p>VERBAL DECLERATIONS – Any announced action must be taken. If you say “raise” then you must raise. If you say “call” then you must call. This is to keep people from making an announcement to see other players reactions, and then changing their mind.</p><br><br>
      <p>SHOWING CARDS ON ALL-IN – Once there is no more action possible in a hand, all players involved must show their hands. This just makes the game more interesting and is a common rule these days.</p><br><br>
      <p>CARDS OVERRULE ANNOUNCEMENTS – If, at the end of a hand, a player announces “a pair of Kings” but actually has a hand higher than the announced hand, such as a straight, the cards play, not the announced hand. Sometimes people miss things, and it is only fair that the best hand shown actually wins the pot.</p><br><br>
      <p>SHOWING FOLDED CARDS – You may not show your folded cards to anybody still in a hand. Also, if a hand is shown to one person, it must be shown to all.</p><br><br>
      <p>SHOWING CALLED HANDS – Any hand that is involved in a pot to the end must be shown if requested. This means that if you call somebody’s bet at the end, and they show you the winning hand, you must show your cards if anybody wants to see what you had.</p><br><br>
      <p>MIS-DEALS – Mis-deals can be called for any valid reason. If a hand is dealt but a player was missed and did not receive any cards, a mis-deal will be called. If the cards are being dealt and a card is accidentally flipped over, it is ANY player’s option to call a mis-deal. In this case the dealt player has the option to keep the card, or ask for a new card. If a new card is requested, the rest of the hand will be dealt as normal, and the top card given as a replacement. The replaced card will then act as the first burn card. If there is more than one card flipped up during a deal, a mis-deal will be called.</p><br><br>
      <p>DEAD CARDS – If a card goes off the table and hits the floor during a hand, it is considered dead. The player’s hand would not be dead, just the card, unless both cards hit the floor. If a card goes off the table while being dealt, a mis-deal will be called.</p><br><br>
      <p>BLINDS – There will always be a Small Blind then a Big Blind after the Button. This means that when a player is busted out of a tournament, the blinds move on as normal, and it is possible for people to miss a blind at times.</p><br><br>
      <p>SIDE POTS – Side pots are used when needed. For example, if four players are in a hand, but one is all-in, the other players are still able to bet into a side pot that will only be won by one of them.</p><br><br>
      <p>PLACING DEALER BUTTON – At the beginning of all tournaments cards are dealt to decide who starts with the button. The high card wins, with an ace being the highest down to a 2 being the lowest. If there is a tie, the first person clockwise after the person dealing out the cards will receive the button.</p><br><br>
      <p>TOURNAMENT TIES – If two or more people bust out on the same hand, the players with more chips at the start of the hand will place higher. For example, player A had $1100 in chips and player B had $1250 in chips at the start of the hand. If they both bust out, then player B will place higher than player A. If the players both had the same number of chips to start the hand, then they will tie and will both receive the awarded points and split any prize money.</p><br><br>
      <p>HAND TIES – Only five cards play in any hand. If the board shows 3 4 6 7 J and two players have a 5 to make a 7 high straight, they TIE. There is no going to a 6th card, or using any other method for a tiebreaker.</p><br><br>
      <p>POT TIES – In the event of a tie, the pot will be divided evenly among the winning players. If there are any extra chips in the pot that can not be split up evenly, they will go to the first winning player after the button.</p><br><br>
      <p>DEALS – Players can make deals at the end of the tournament. There may not be more than 3 players involved in a deal, and only the money can be dealt. Players that make a deal will place, and receive points for, their placement, based on their chip stacks at the time of a deal. Because of this, if any players involved in a deal have the same number of chips, a deal can not be made until more hands are played and there is no longer a tie.</p><br><br>
      <p>MOVING TABLES – When it is necessary for a player to move tables, the player will be moved into an empty seat, as close as possible to the same position they currently were at on their old table. For example, if a player was to be on the button at the old table, they will be positioned as close as possible to being on the button at the new table.</p><br><br>
      <p>COLORING UP CHIPS – When chips are being colored up, any leftover chips will be rounded up. For example, if we are exchanging out all of the $25 and $50 chips and a player has either $25, $50 or $75 in chips to color up, they will receive one $100 chip.</p><br><br>
      <p>OVERSIZED CHIP CALL – If a bet has been made and a following player puts out an oversized chip, it is assumed a call. For example, if the bet is $200 and a player puts out a $500 chip without first announcing a raise, it is then assumed a call and change will be given. If you wish to make a raise, you must announce that you are making a raise, and announce the amount. If a player only announces a raise, but no amount, it is assumed that the raise is for the total amount of the chip, in this case a raise to $500.</p><br><br>
      <p>ETIQUETTE – Please treat other players with respect at all times. If a player makes what you think is a “stupid call” you do not have the right to put them down in any way. In other words, acting like that idiot Phil Helmuth will not be tolerated. Also, do not throw anything. I understand that poker can be an emotional game, but please do not let emotions get the best of you. Players will receive one warning and then any other incidents in the same night will lead to an ejection and forfeit of money. If I have to keep warning a player about this over multiple games, they will not be allowed to participate in the league any longer.</p><br><br>
      <p>BETTING – No splashing the pot! When you make a bet, you must place it out in front of you and it must be able to be counted. If you throw the chips into the middle, there is no way to verify what was bet, which can lead to deceitful play. Players will receive one warning and then any other incidents will lead to the hand being folded and any chips thrown in the middle forfeited. The minimum bet is equal to the current big blind.</p><br><br>
      <p>CARDS MUST BE VISIBLE AT ALL TIMES – Your cards must remain on the table, or in your hands in view at all times. You may not hold your cards below the table, or place them somewhere off of the table. Players will receive one warning, and then any other incidents will lead to the hand being folded and money in the pot forfeited. This is another rule to keep players from being deceitful.</p><br><br>
      <p>CHEATING – Any player caught cheating will be immediately ejected from the tournament and the league, and will have all money forfeited. If cheating has occurred in a game, the game will be nullified and started over. I think this is the fairest way to handle it because if cheating was going on, there is no telling how the tournament would have played out.</p><br><br>
